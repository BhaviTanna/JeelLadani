	                <p class="detail mt-5">According to Islam, it is believed that the Holy Quran, which is the holy book of Islam, was first revealed to Prophet Muhammad during the month of Ramadan. Eid-ul-Fitr is the feast marking the end of this holy month and the start of next month, Shawwal. Eid-ul-Fitr was originated by Prophet Muhammad.The Ramzan fast, observed during the whole month begins daily from the time the first streak of daylight is observed on the horizon till nightfall when the stars become clearly visible. During the day even drinking water is prohibited but food is permitted to be eaten at night. Muslims spent the day in reading the Koran.</p>

            <h1  class="head mt-5"><b>2.Bakri-Id</b></h1>
		        <div class="card mb-3 mt-5">
		    	
		            <img src="i2.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="..." width="200px" height="500px" >
		 
		        </div>

		            <p class="detail mt-5">Bakri-Id is one of the Muslim festivals, the celebration of which is enjoined in Koran and it commemorates Abraham's sacrifice of his beloved son in obedience to God's command. Abraham having implicit faith in God decided to offer the sacrifice. Abraham blindfolded himself and killed his son but when he removed the bandage from his eyes, found his son standing before him with a slain ram at the altar. Therefore, for Bakri-Id every Muslim family is required to sacrifice a healthy animal and distribute two-thirds of the meat among the poor. A full grown camel, cow, goat or sheep free from disease is considered the best offering with a short prayer which is an absolute surrendering of the soul and acknowledging the greatness of Allah.</p>

		    
            <h1  class="head mt-5"><b>3.Muharram</b></h1>
		        <div class="card mb-3 mt-5">
		    	
		            <img src="i3.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="..." width="100px" height="450px" >
		 
		        </div>

		            <p class="detail mt-5">The first Muslim month is Muharram and Muharram is observed on the tenth day of this month. Muharram is a day of mourning as it commemorates , what is considered the greatest tragedy in the history of Islam-the martyrdom of the Prophet's grandson Hussein. The long processions with their Taziahs which are the gorgeous replicas of the martyr's tomb, the masked dancers and the colorful crowds, give Muharram the appearance of a gay festival but in reality it is an expression of grief and distress.</p>        

            
            <h1  class="head mt-5"><b>4.Id-I-Milad</b></h1>
		        <div class="card mb-3 mt-5">
		    	
		            <img src="i4.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="..." width="200px" height="450px" >
		 
		        </div>

		            <p class="detail mt-5">The prophet was born on the twelfth day of the third month of the Muslim year and his death anniversary also falls on the same date. During the twelve days of sickness of the Prophet which ended in his death, sermons are delivered in mosques by learned men. Also a ceremony known as the "Sandal Rite" is performed over the symbolic foot-prints of the Prophet in stone, kept in some households or mosques. A replica of Burag, the horse on which the Prophet is believed to have ascended to heaven is kept near the foot-prints and is anointed with Sandal Paste. And the casket of foot-prints are decorated and illuminated. The twelfth day, which is the Urs proper, is observed quietly and spent in prayers and alms-giving.</p>

		    <h1  class="head mt-5"><b>5.Shab-I-Barat</b></h1>
		        <div class="card mb-3 mt-5">
		    	
		            <img src="i5.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="..." width="200px" height="450px" >
		 
		        </div>

		            <p class="detail mt-5">This feast is held either on the thirteenth or on the fourteenth day of the eighth month of the Muslim year. It is a nocturnal observance as the fortunes of all mortals for the coming year are to be registered in heaven during the night. Fatiha, which means blessings are recited over the food and the sweet dishes in the name of the Prophet, his daughter Fatima and her husband Ali.</p>
