		            <p class="detail mt-5">This day celebrates the birth of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, founder and first Guru of Sikhism. It is considered one of the most sacred Sikh festivals. Most Sikhs have traditionally celebrated Guru Nanak Jayanti in November, following the Nanakshahi calendar, However, some scholars believe it should be celebrated on Baisakhi Day, usually falling in April. (The Guru was born on Baisakhi Day, April 5, 1469, in what is now Punjab Province, Pakistan.Two days before the actual celebration, festivities begin that include Akhand Paath, a 48-hour uninterrupted reading of the Guru Granth Sahib at gurdwaras, which are adorned with flowers and lights. The next day, Sikhs visit the gurdwara to chant hymns and hold Nagar Kirtan[link]. On the festival day, celebrations include readings, music, assemblies and a langar, or community kitchen, where volunteers serve food and karah prashad, a special sweet.</p>

		            <p class="detail mt-5">Sikhs and Hindus, especially in India’s Punjab region, both mark the first of the month of Magh. In Sikhism, Maghi honors the martyred Chali Mukte (40 Liberated Ones), killed as they resisted an attack on Guru Gobind Singh. The battle took place on 30 Poh (December 29) in Muktsar, Punjab in 1705. The fallen were cremated the next day, 1 Magh, which generally falls on January 14 or 15. Hindus across India celebrate the day as Makar Sankranti and other names.Maghi customs include recitals of the entire Guru Granth Sahib, bathing in holy water, charitable giving and eating kheer (sweet rice porridge). The largest celebration takes place over three days in Muktsar. Believers bathe in the sarovar, or sacred pool, and visit shrines associated with the battle. On the third day, they walk together from the main shrine to the Tibbi Sahib gurdwara, sacred to Guru Gobind. </p>

		            <p class="detail mt-5">Sikhs honor the birth of Guru Gobind Singh, the 10th and last human Guru, on 23 Poh, or January 5. (Some regions observe it according to different calendars). He was born in 1666 at Patna Sahib, India, and became the Sikh leader at age nine after his father, Guru Tegh Bahadur, was executed by the Mughal emperor.Guru Gobind is revered as a devout spiritual leader who made major contributions to Sikh ideology and writing, as well as a fearless protector of all people from oppression and injustice. He initiated the Khalsa community[https://theguibordcenter.org/faiths/sikhism/sikh-festivals-and-observances/#baisakhi] to stand against injustice and named the Adi Granth as the final, eternal Guru and spiritual authority of Sikhdom.Sikhs celebrate the occasion with processions and singing, gathering at gurdwaras for prayer and spiritual discourse, and reciting poems and hymns. A langar (community meal) is also prepared for believers.</p>

		            <p class="detail mt-5">Hola Mohalla (“mock fight”) is a Sikh festival that takes place on the first full moon of March. Following Guru Gobind Singh’s tradition, it follows the Hindu festival Holi by one day. (“Hola” is the masculine form of the feminine “holi.”)While Holi is a playful event, on Hola Mohalla Sikhs demonstrate their martial skills in simulated battles. During the festival, celebrants move to a given spot in army-style formation, accompanied by war drums and standard bearers. Guru Gobind held the first such mock fight in February 1701 at Anandpur</p>

		            <p class="detail mt-5">Bandi Chhor Divas (“Day of Liberation”) is a holiday that coincides with the Hindu festival of Diwali. Sikhs have historically celebrated Diwali and Vaisakhi with Hindus. In the late 20th century, Sikh religious leaders began calling the day Bandi Chhor Divas. In 2003, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, the Sikh elected leaders, adopted the name along with the Nanakshahi calendar.<br><br>The holiday celebrates the release from prison of Guru Hargobind, the sixth Sikh guru, in 1619. According to tradition, Emperor Jahangir agreed to release the Guru, who asked him to also free 52 Hindu kings imprisoned with him. The Emperor agreed, but limited the number by releasing only those prisoners who held onto the Guru’s cloak tail. However, the Guru had a cloak made with 52 panels attached, so each king could hold onto it and leave.Guru Hargobind arrived in Amritsar a few days later on Diwali. In celebration, the Golden Temple and the entire city lit up with lamps and candles. Sikhs continue this tradition of lighting homes and temples on Bandi Chhor Divas. They also exchange gifts and feast with family and friends.</p>

		            <p class="detail mt-5">After Arjan Dev installed the first edition of the Adi Granth in the Golden Temple in 1604, rivals later stole it. Gobind Singh—the 10th and last human Sikh Guru—took on the task of recreating the entire scripture. Guru Gobind dictated all verses he considered revealed, including verses written since the first edition, to a Sikh scholar. The project took almost five years and was completed in 1705.<br><br>On October 20, 1708, Guru Gobind gave his last sermon and conferred permanent gurudom on the second edition of the Granth. Since then, the book has become known as Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Sikhs view it as their perpetual living Guru and guide. Believers do not worship the scripture but treat it with reverence for its wisdom and spiritual teaching. They stand when the Guru Granth Sahib is brought into a room. In gurdwaras (houses of worship), Sikhs keep the scripture on a raised platform and open, read and close it ceremoniously.</p>

	                <p class="detail mt-5">Vaisakhi (also spelled Baisakhi), the first day of the month of Vaisakh, is a major harvest festival and religious observance for Hindus and Sikhs. For Sikhs, the day commemorates Guru Gobind Singh’s founding of the Khalsa warrior community.Vaisakhi is celebrated worldwide and especially in India’s Punjabi region. The most important custom is Nagar Kirtan, a procession led by five men with orange banners representing the Five Beloved Ones. Sikhs visit the gurdwara with offerings, bathe in sacred pools, attend kirtans (musical programs) and perform community service.</p>
